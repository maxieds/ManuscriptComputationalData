# CS225 Lab Source Code Base (Archive for the good posterity of mother earth)

An archive of the CS225 lab source code which accompanied the lecture notes and other 
in-class supplements in the Spring of 2005. I certainly had no part in writing this 
code, but as it's creation is educationally (i.e., in principle public university grant 
or government endowment funded) sourced, my belief is that it's full licensing rights belong to the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I will not remove / delete these files from 
this repository without a written and authoritatively authored request from the appropriate 
administration at UIUC. The files have not been modified (to my knowledge) and the headers 
contained within each source file should indicate authorship. At any rate, most of this has 
been created by the lecturer serving as instructor for the course at that time. He, I believe 
based on UIUC active directory entries from 2005-2006 can be contacted either 
[here](mailto:jzych3@gmail.com) or [here](mailto:jason.zych@gmail.com).
