# CS225 Lab Source Code Base

## Archived for the good posterity of mother earth: 

An archive of the CS225 lab source code which accompanied the lecture notes and other 
in-class supplements in the Spring of 2005. I certainly had no part in writing this 
code, but as it's creation is educationally (i.e., in principle public university grant 
or government endowment funded) sourced, my belief is that it's full licensing rights belong to the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I will not remove / delete these files from 
this repository without a written and authoritatively authored request from the appropriate 
administration at UIUC. The files have not been modified (to my knowledge) and the headers 
contained within each source file should indicate authorship. At any rate, most of this has 
been created by the lecturer serving as instructor for the course at that time. He, I believe 
based on UIUC active directory entries from 2005-2006 can be contacted either 
[here](mailto:jzych3@gmail.com) or [here](mailto:jason.zych@gmail.com). 

I have received personal artifacts of approval from Cinda and Margaret Fleck who we 
assume knows this territory well enough these days to give her implicit thumbs up.
In the name of being more positive in general about things as they are, I am choosing to 
honor Cinda's predecessor for the educationally finer points of his tenure at UIUC rather 
than for other complaints I have with the man interpersonally built up over the years since 
I first fetched this code off of the EWS machine's repositiory of C++ knowledge in 2005. 
It is perhaps best that we focus on the finer points of *Vector225.cpp/h* and how 
exaggeratedly commented it is for newbies to the art and computer science of data structures in C++. 
Since this code base does not any longer exist on the web except for with vague whispers and shunned darker 
corners occupied by its guarding trolls, I have decided to step up and post this in a completely 
unmodified format for educational viewers here. I do not know at this time whether it still 
compiles with a modern g++ nor whether upgrades to the C++ standards have necessarily 
deprecated its practical uses in application. 

Enjoy!

## Newsreader-type interactions for the intellectually curious:

### Let's all first choose to thank the author for their contributions to this code

```
#!/bin/bash
HELL_FREEZES_OVER = ((2**32))
int_i="0"
while[ $int_i -lt $HELL_FREEZES_OVER ]; do
     echo -e "So long, and thanks for all the code, \t\t\t\t\t\t\tJason!" | \
              mail -s "See message line." jason.zych@gmail.com;
     int_i=$[$int_i + 1];
fi
```

### And, conversely, acknowledege a meanacing precursor to the DMCA takedown philosopy exercised recently at UIUC

## Old news at UIUC (RE: patent and copyright laws):

My father Don paid a lot of money for me to sit in those programming courses many years ago. 
In addition to this being my way of issuing a *neiner-neiner-boo-boo* at the man, myth, and 
legend of CS classes past and his successful bans of this before we came to recognize this 
as a DMCA issue at institutions of higher learning, there is precedent for why this blatant 
disregard of authorship (i.e., vs ownership vis a vis distribution rights). See below:

* [Article I](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/11/11/homework-help-companies-continue-raise-copyright-academic-integrity-issues)
* [Article II](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/university-bans-github-homework-changes-mind/)

# Summing it up 

## As in like a geometric series rigorously justifying ones hash table implementation:

By all means, know your rights (in general). And be sure to thank the creator of this code fodder elsewhere in this 
folder by thanking him personally over and over as many times as your 32-bit port of my script feels the need 
to cycle. 

## Addendum 

<img src="https://github.com/maxieds/ManuscriptComputationalData/blob/master/misc/other-publicly-funded/HaHaMeSoGraded.png" />

The [license file commit comment here](https://github.com/maxieds/ManuscriptComputationalData/commit/05a7b002d32579e9de3bdeef8575ac90d93d19c7#commitcomment-32239355) explains the choice of "*copyleft*" filler for the underspecified licensing specs implied by this code base which residually belongs to UIUC as a product of its educational system that be. It also clarifies some smaller order points about where practically (and formally legally) this license can actually be assumed to apply to the files in this (sub)repository. In particular, while *neiner-neiner-boo-boo-ing* at the author with toungue firmly in cheek, I still feel it's important enough to acknowledge *authorship rights* in so much as we can protect them with *copyrights* in some other entity's possesion, especially seeing as this was prime state-of-the-art source code within a highly ranked CS school at its time. Let's also be sure to [thank Jason](https://github.com/maxieds/ManuscriptComputationalData/tree/master/misc/other-publicly-funded#newsreader-type-interactions-for-the-intellectually-curious) once again and welcome him to the club of open source contributors for giving us this source code pr0n fodder to dwell on, shall we? And -- note that we shouldn't remember him for the asshat he was, but rather for the finer points which can still be found in his lectures today ...
