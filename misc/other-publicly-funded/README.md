# CS225 Lab Source Code Base (Archive for the good posterity of mother earth)

An archive of the CS225 lab source code which accompanied the lecture notes and other 
in-class supplements in the Spring of 2005. I certainly had no part in writing this 
code, but as it's creation is educationally (i.e., in principle public university grant 
or government endowment funded) sourced, my belief is that it's full licensing rights belong to the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I will not remove / delete these files from 
this repository without a written and authoritatively authored request from the appropriate 
administration at UIUC. The files have not been modified (to my knowledge) and the headers 
contained within each source file should indicate authorship. At any rate, most of this has 
been created by the lecturer serving as instructor for the course at that time. He, I believe 
based on UIUC active directory entries from 2005-2006 can be contacted either 
[here](mailto:jzych3@gmail.com) or [here](mailto:jason.zych@gmail.com). 

I have received personal artifacts of approval from Cinda and Margaret Fleck who we 
assume knows this territory well enough these days to give her implicit thumbs up.
In the name of being more positive in general about things as they are, I am choosing to 
honor Cinda's predecessor for the educationally finer points of his tenure at UIUC rather 
than for other complaints I have with the man interpersonally built up over the years since 
I first fetched this code off of the EWS machine's repositiory of C++ knowledge in 2005. 
It is perhaps best that we focus on the finer points of *Vector225.cpp/h* and how 
exaggeratedly commented it is for newbies to the art and computer science of data structures in C++. 
Since this code base does not any longer exist on the web except for with vague whispers and shunned darker 
corners occupied by its guarding trolls, I have decided to step up and post this in a completely 
unmodified format for educational viewers here. I do not know at this time whether it still 
compiles with a modern g++ nor whether upgrades to the C++ standards have necessarily 
deprecated its practical uses in application. 

Enjoy!
