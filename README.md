# ManuscriptComputationalData

A place to post the computational data that goes along with most of my submitted manuscripts in place of Google Drive links to Mathematica and Sage notebooks. 

# Links to these files in print

1. The notebook [*square-series-summary.nb*](https://github.com/maxieds/ManuscriptComputationalData/blob/master/square-series-summary.nb) is a summary document intended to assist reviewers and (possibly) inspire readers of my *Square Series* article formerly published in the now apparently defunct *Journal of Inequalities and Special Functions*. A persisting ArXiv pre-print link to the article is however still to be found [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02803). (*Perhaps I should have this article painfully re-reviewed?*) 
2. The notebook [*gftransforms-hzeta-summary.nb*](https://github.com/maxieds/ManuscriptComputationalData/blob/master/gftransforms-hzeta-summary.nb) is a most recent, and up-to-date, working notebook file to accompany my two manuscripts published in the *Online Journal of Analytic Combinatorics* in 2017 [here](http://web.math.rochester.edu/misc/ojac/vol12/137.pdf) and in 2018 [here](http://web.math.rochester.edu/misc/ojac/vol13/158.pdf). 
3. The notebook [*sod-formulas.nb*](https://github.com/maxieds/ManuscriptComputationalData/blob/master/sod-formulas.nb) provides a reviewer-friendly comutational guide experimentally verifying the results found in [this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03488). The article is still under review. Current adviser Ernie should be advised that these new formulas are better (so says *the author*) than some people would like to acknowledge on first rudimentary read. 

# License

If it is up to me, where not explicitly otherwise bound by publisher agreements of active in-print articles, I intend for these supplementary reference files to be given *as-is* to interested readers. That is to say, that unless bound by the links above, these files are freely available as "*open source*" works under the most permissive *Creative Commons* scheme readers find fit. **--Maxie**
